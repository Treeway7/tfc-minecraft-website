# About

The Finest Creations includes an *optional modpack,* allowing you to play with a massive performance boost, as well as features like a minimap, better item sorting, villager trade cycling, accurate singleplayer worlds, and even Litematica!

Alternatively, feel free to put together your own modpack! The server is completely vanilla friendly.


# Modpack Installation Guide

1. **Download Prism Launcher.** It's much easier to launch modded Minecraft with this app!
https://prismlauncher.org/

2. **Download Java.**
<https://adoptium.net/>
You'll need to actually download it to use this launcher.
Click the big "Latest LTS Release" button.
When opening Prism for the first time, it will auto-detect Java for you.

3. **Download the TFC modpack** from my GitHub.
<https://github.com/Treeway7/TheFinestCreations/releases>

4. **Import it into Prism.** Click `Add instance` at the top left corner, and then click `Import from zip`. Choose the modpack you just downloaded!

5. **Click "Open missing" if prompted.** The launcher will open a bunch of CurseForge tabs, and download a couple of mods that way.

6. **Allocate more RAM!** This step may be important to keep your game from freezing!

On Windows, you can check your RAM in the Task Manager app. Switch to the `Performance` tab at the top, and then click the purple `Memory` tab. On the right side, it will say `__ GB`.

Back to Prism, click `Settings` at the top of the window, then go to `Java`.
In `Maximum memory allocation`, write the following number according to your computer's RAM:

4GB: `3072`
6GB: `4096`
8GB: `6144`
16+ GB: `8124`
Don't set it any higher than `8124`, even if you have the RAM for it!

7. **Connect to the server!**
IP: check #server-info in Discord

8. Add yourself to the server using the Discord bot command `/whitelist add [minecraft username]`. Alt accounts are allowed!
