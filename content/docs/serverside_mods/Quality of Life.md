# Datapacks

## [Vanilla Tweaks](https://vanillatweaks.net/)

The following Vanilla Tweak datapacks are on the server:

- Anti Enderman Grief
- Armor Statues
- Bat Membranes (Phantoms don't spawn in the overworld!)
- Custom Portals
- Double Shulker Shells
- Dragon Drops

- More Mob Heads

## [Block Rotator](https://github.com/GoldenDelicios/block_rotator)

Rename a Carrot on a Stick to `Wrench` (case sensitive). This creates a new tool that will rotate any sort of turnable block!

## [Trimmable Tools](https://modrinth.com/datapack/trimmable-tools?hl=en-US)

Allows tools to get cool ore trims. Requires a resource pack, which the server or the optional modpack can provide.

# Mods

## [Universal Graves](https://modrinth.com/mod/universal-graves?hl=en-US)

Prevents you from dropping or despawning your items on death.

Your items will be protected from other players for 1 minute. After that, anyone could pick up your stuff.

## [Trade Cycling](https://modrinth.com/mod/trade-cycling)

Allows for villager trades to be cycled when they first get a job.

This mod doesn't work in vanilla - it must be added to a player's mod folder for it to work.

## [TrashSlot](https://modrinth.com/mod/trashslot?hl=en-US)

Adds a trash slot to your inventory.

This mod doesn't work in vanilla - it must be added to a player's mod folder for it to work.

## [Where Is It](https://modrinth.com/mod/where-is-it)

Hover your cursor over an item in your inventory, then press Y to locate it in chests around you.

This mod doesn't work in vanilla - it must be added to a player's mod folder for it to work.

## [Followers Teleport Too](https://modrinth.com/mod/followers-teleport-too)

Allows for your pets to teleport with you when you use teleport commands.

Note that pets will be invulnerable for 20 seconds after warping to prevent them from suffocating or taking fall damage.

## [Scaffolding Drops Nearby](https://modrinth.com/mod/scaffolding-drops-nearby)

If you break a tower of scaffolding , it'll all drop neatly next to your feet instead of all over the place.

## [Forgiving Void](https://modrinth.com/mod/forgiving-void?hl=en-US)

If you fall into the void (ie. in The End or by breaking through bedrock), you will be warped to the top of the world instead of dying. When you land, you will take 9.5 hearts of damage. If a player had full health, they would be left at half a heart.

## [No Chat Reports](https://modrinth.com/mod/no-chat-reports/versions?hl=en-US)

Disables chat reporting on this server (where possible).

## [JEI](https://modrinth.com/mod/jei?hl=en-US)/[EMI](https://modrinth.com/mod/emi?hl=en-US) Support

These are both installed on the server for your crafting convenience!
