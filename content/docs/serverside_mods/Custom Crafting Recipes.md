# TFC's Exclusive Recipes

## Rotten Flesh to Leather

Smelt Rotten Flesh in a furnace to convert it to Leather.

## Bundle from Leather

The bundle recipe usually uses rabbit hide. Now you can craft it using Leather, too!

# Datapacks

## [OmniCut](https://modrinth.com/datapack/omnicut-better-wood-stone-cutter/version/1.11.0+1.20?hl=en-US)

Adds a bunch of convenient stonecutting and wood cutting recipes!

## [Slab Hero](https://github.com/Treeway7/slab_hero)

Adds slab to block conversion recipes.

TFC uses a custom version of this datapack that only affects wood slabs and the purpur slab. OmniCut handles the rest!
