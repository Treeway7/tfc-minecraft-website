The server runs on chorb's performance stack. For the full list, check #general's pinned messages in the [Luna Pixel Studios Discord](https://discord.com/invite/lunapixel).

Here is a list of mods that shouldn't impact vanilla gameplay mechanics:

- ModernFix
- Lithium
- Redirectionor
- ImmediatelyFast
- Smooth Chunk Save
- FerriteCore
- Memory Leak Fix
- Connectivity
- Structure Essentials
- Chunk Sending
- Client Crafting
- Very Many Players

# [Debugify](https://modrinth.com/mod/debugify?hl=en-US)

Fixes a variety of bugs that Mojang never did.

# [Player Head Name Fix](https://modrinth.com/mod/headfix/version/1.2.2-1.20)

Renamed player heads that have been placed and then destroyed again will retain their name.

# [Let Me Despawn](https://modrinth.com/plugin/lmd?hl=en-US)

Despawns mobs that are holding items like any other mob would. Name tagged mobs will never despawn, per usual.

# [Alternate Current](https://modrinth.com/mod/alternate-current?hl=en-US)

Reduces redstone lag. The way it calculates redstone signals may break some machines.

If you are facing gamebreaking redstone issues, let me know on Discord and we can try a different mod.

# [Better Chunk Loading](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/better-chunk-loading-forge-fabric)

Changes how chunks are loaded. It predicts player movement and loads chunks they're moving into.

# [spark](https://modrinth.com/mod/spark?hl=en-US)

Lets you run a performance test, kind of like Task Manager. This is mostly for server operators.
