## Anti-Griefing
### [Convenient mobGriefing](https://modrinth.com/mod/convenient-mobgriefing)

Splits the `/gamerule mobGriefing` into four distinct categories, allowing for the Wither and Ender Dragon's griefing to be toggled separately!

On this server, `/gamerule mobGriefing false` disables creeper, enderman and ghast griefing, as well as preventing silverfish infestation. If you're playing on Hard mode in singleplayer, it also prevents zombies from breaking doors.

Lastly, it disables other minor things, like non-player entities shooting TNT with burning projectiles, and ravagers destroying leaves.

### [Fire Spread Tweaks](https://modrinth.com/mod/fire-spread-tweaks)

When a fire is lit, ie. from lava, lightning or your own flint and steel, it will not spread, and the fire will be extinguished after a moment.

## Villagers

### [Villager Tweaks](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/villagertweaks)

- Villagers are now guaranteed to be converted to zombie villagers in Easy or Normal mode.
- Curing a zombie villager takes 15 seconds instead of the usual 3 minutes.
- Trade prices are global.
- Hitting a villager will not cause a price penalty.

### [Trade Cycling](https://modrinth.com/mod/trade-cycling)

Allows for villager trades to be cycled when they first get a job.

This mod doesn't work in vanilla - it also must be added to a player's mod folder for it to work.

## Passive Mobs

### [Dismount Entity](https://modrinth.com/mod/dismount-entity)

### [Followers Teleport Too](https://modrinth.com/mod/followers-teleport-too)

Allows for your pets to teleport with you when you use teleport commands.

Note that pets will be invulnerable for 20 seconds after warping to prevent them from suffocating or taking fall damage.
