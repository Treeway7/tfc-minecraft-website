# Max Level Tweaks

Certain enchantment caps have been raised for your convenience:

- Efficiency: 5 -> 7
- Unbreaking: 3 -> 4
- Looting: 3 -> 4

# Anvils

## Cheap Names

The cost for renaming an item has been reduced to 1 level every time!

## Removed "Too Expensive!"

You can now apply enchantments in anvils as much as you'd like, provided you have the experience for it.

## Anvil Cost Reduced to 1.5x

Usually it costs double the experience every time to add enchantments to equipment. Not anymore.

## [Colorful Anvils](https://modrinth.com/mod/colorfulanvils)

A separate mod that allows items to have custom hex colors when renamed in an anvil!

For a colored text tutorial, see the colored name tutorial in the Fun & Decoration category.

# Miscellaneous

## Axe Weapons

Allows axes to receive Fire Aspect, Looting and Knockback.

## Bow Infinity Fix

No arrow? No problem! Allows bows enchanted with Infinity to shoot without you needing an arrow in your inventory.

## Infinity + Mending

Infinity or Mending... Why not both? Bows can now have both enchants!

## Loyal Void Tridents

Your loyalty trident won't be lost if you chuck it into the void.
