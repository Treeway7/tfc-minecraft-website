# Teleportation

In order to teleport with commands, you'll need to stand still for three seconds.

This server uses the Blossom series of mods: [BlossomHomes](https://modrinth.com/mod/blossomhomes), [BlossomTPA](https://modrinth.com/mod/blossomtpa) and [BlossomBack](https://modrinth.com/mod/blossomback).

## Homes

You can set homes with `/sethome [home name]`, allowing you to warp anywhere with `/home [home name]`.

Delete a home using `/delhome [home name]`.

On this server, up to 1000 warp points can be created this way.

## TPA

Type `/tpa [player]` to request to teleport to them.

`/tpahere [player]` will request for a player to teleport to you.

## Back and Last Death

After teleporting, `/back` will take you back to the previous location you teleported from.

`/lastdeath` will take you to the last point you died. (Note that this will clip you into your gravestone.)

## Minecarts

Minecarts now move much faster, and they're optimized for quick turns!

With a top speed of 34m/s, minecarts move 4 times faster than usual, rivaling the speed of packed ice boat transportation!
See the [Transportation Methods](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Transportation#Methods) wiki page for a detailed comparison.
